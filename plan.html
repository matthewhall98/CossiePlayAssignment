	<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>

	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p>The mission is to boost CossiePlay's revenue from their custom made costumes per week while also increasing the attendance rate for younger audiences at the monthly held costume parties. Cossieplay has stated that the average current production rate for costumes is about four costumes per week, this data can be used as a baseline for measurement when evaluating the success rate to see if this weekly average has improved. Secondly, the current attendance range for the monthly held costume parties is roughly thirty people attending with an age range between thirty-five and fifty years old. CossiePlay wishes to appeal to younger audiences such as high-school students and young adults as this would increase the fun of each of the parties while also raising revenue.</p>

	<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
		<p>The success of the mission will be evaluated by first conducting a detailed tally of the amount of people attenting each party per month while
        also averaging out the amount of costumes made and sold per week before the site is published. After gathering this data the site will be 				
        published and two more tallies will be conducted each within a month period from one another and the day of the site's launch. The data gathered 
        from these three different time frames will then be correlated and compared in order to effectively determine if the goal (increase in attendence        and sales) has been achieved and just how effective it has been. It was considered that a site counter could have been implemented however this 
        would only gather information on the amount of people visiting the site and wouldn't be very useful in providing information towards whether the 
        site's mission had been achieved or not.</p>
        
	<h2>Target Audience</h2>
		<p>The site should be tailored towards younger audiences such as high-school students and young adults. To effectively entice customers to purchase custom costumes and to attend the monthly parties certain design processes are cruical for the success of the CossiePlay website. Firstly, the amount of text on each page should be minimal (no long paragraphs) and important information should be either highlighted or set in bold in order to enable the user to skim read each page (aka very few young people find lots of words appealing). Many younger people appeal more towards visual representations rather than text based information, however images are often too vague and very rarely get the design point across on their own. Therefore a hybrid of the two should be incorperated into the site's design (i.e. have images of a costume party on the information page about the parties).<br><br>
        
        Secondly, it is essential that all material that would differ younger people from attending the parties each month is hidden. This can be done effectively by simply placing the giving party guidelines at the bottom of the sign-up page in smaller writing than the standardised paragraphs. The mass majority of younger generations despise being told what they can and can't do. Therefore this basic design concept will make this information less visable however still easily accessable.<br><br>
        
The sign-up page and the store page will be the most important out of all the other pages. Therefore in order to entice users to go to these pages there should be several calls to action on every other page. This can be done by adding a 'come party with us' popup on the sidebar with an appropriate image to suit the party sign up page while also providing a clickable link to the sign-up page itself. The store page can be advertised by showing off various cosplay costumes at the bottom of every page (other than the sign-up and store page so that people absorb all the information on these pages) with a clickable call to action underneath that links directly to the store page that says 'if you like these costumes check out our second hand one for sale!'<br><br>
        
It is crucial that important components (i.e. Sign-up, Announcements, Contacts, Store, etc.) take priority over less important components (i.e. Links) and are positioned in their appropriate places to enable a very easy navigation system. The navigation should be as basic as possible (no pages within pages) as from the personal view of a young adult i  find that i will lose interest in the meaning of a web page if i have to go out of my way to actually search for things. In order to easily appeal to younger audiences the site should look professional and make effective use of a specific colour pallet (use contrasting colours such as red & white) as this will make the site look more appealling to the eye, thus enticing young people to take part in the various services that the site will offer (Party sign-ups, Store, etc.).<br><br>

Consistency is key when developing an effective and professional website. Therefore the same formats and layouts for each page should be used throughout all web pages. This will ensure that the user feels as if they haven't left the site and that they are still on the Cossieplay website. It is important that the same image styles are used throughout the website as well (if one image is in the shape of a circle the majority of the others should be as well).</p>
